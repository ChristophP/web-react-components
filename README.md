# WIP

!!! WIP !!!

This should be a web components wrapper for react components.

Problems to solve:

- how to pass children? (Transform to Vdom?) -> works
- how to pass non string attributes(there is no list of attributes known)?
- will this work for React components that are just functions or do they have to be classes?
- how to pass handlers (likely via dispatching an event)?
- exclude `data-reactid` attributes from being passed to react
